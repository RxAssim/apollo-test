      This is a template that you can use to demonstrate an error in
      Apollo Client. Edit the source code and watch your browser window
      reload with the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code which renders this component lives in{" "}
      <code>./src/App.js</code>.

      The GraphQL schema is in <code>./src/graphql/schema</code>.
      Currently the schema just serves a list of people with names and
      ids.
